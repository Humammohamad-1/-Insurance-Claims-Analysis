# 🩺 Insurance Claims Analytics – Power BI Project

This project demonstrates a professional Power BI dashboard analyzing **synthetic health insurance claims data**, generated with Python. The dashboard offers visual insights into claims performance, member behavior, and diagnosis trends.

---

## 📊 Key Dashboard Features

- **KPI Cards**: Total claims, average amount, total policies, member count  
- **Claims by Specialty, City & Diagnosis**  
- **Monthly trend analysis**  
- **Member profile breakdown**: by age group, gender, top claimants  
- **Geographical insights**: Bubble map and diagnosis heatmaps  
- **Dynamic filters and responsive slicers**

---

## 🔬 Python Analysis (Jupyter Notebook)

Complementing the Power BI dashboard, this project includes additional analysis performed in Python using a Jupyter Notebook. It leverages the enriched Power BI dataset to explore:

- Outlier detection using Z-score
- Diagnosis trends by age group and gender
- Claim distribution by specialty and city
- Monthly trends and visual summaries
- Grouped bar charts, boxplots, and annotated line graphs
